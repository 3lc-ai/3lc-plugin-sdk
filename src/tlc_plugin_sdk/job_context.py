"""``JobContext`` — the surface a plugin's ``run_job`` programs against.

This is the v2 job-execution contract from ``docs/plugin-isolation.md``. A plugin
implements ``run_job(ctx)`` and only ever touches ``ctx`` — it never grabs the
host GPU queue or polls a shared ``cancel_flag``. The same object is used in both
``host`` and ``venv`` modes; only the **sink** (where emitted events go) and the
**cancel signal** differ:

- ``venv`` mode: the worker harness gives a sink that enqueues events for the
  streamed control-channel response, and a ``threading.Event`` set by the worker's
  ``/cancel`` endpoint.
- ``host`` mode (later): the host gives a sink that relays straight to SocketIO and
  a cancel event tied to the host queue.

Import-light: stdlib only. Must not pull in the server stack.
