"""The compute-service plugin contract — a behavior-only base class.

A plugin is a subclass of :class:`ComputePlugin`. The base declares the
*behavioral* surface the host (or an out-of-process worker) invokes; all
*metadata* (id, name, ui placement, gpu flag, socketio namespace, …) lives in
the plugin manifest (``[tool.tlc-compute]`` in ``plugin.toml`` /
``pyproject.toml``), the single source of truth. There is **no
metadata on the class** and **no** ``register()`` call at import — the host
discovers a plugin via its manifest ``entrypoint`` and hydrates the instance's
display identity (``id``/``name``/``icon``/``version``) from the card after
construction.

Only ``compute`` and ``get_ui_fragment`` are required (abstract); everything
else is optional behavior with a safe default, so a plugin implements just what
it needs and the host calls every hook directly against the inherited defaults.
