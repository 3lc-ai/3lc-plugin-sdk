"""Build a plugin's HTTP surface as a Litestar ASGI app.

This is the single route-authoring pattern for Layer B (transport unification): a
plugin exposes its custom routes as relative Litestar route handlers via
:meth:`ComputePlugin.get_route_handlers`, and the **same** handlers are served two
ways from the **same** builder:

- **host (in-process):** the compute service builds the app once per plugin
  instance and invokes it directly through the ASGI interface (no socket) — see
  ``plugins/endpoint.py``;
- **venv (out-of-process):** the worker (``plugin_sdk.worker``) serves the app with
  uvicorn on a Unix socket and the host reverse-proxies to it.

Because both modes serve the identical app, a plugin's routes get a real router,
request validation, multipart, and binary/streaming responses in **either** mode,
with no host/venv divergence. Litestar runs ``def`` handlers in a threadpool, so a
synchronous, CPU-bound custom route (e.g. SAM3's preview inference) does not block
the event loop.

The app also mounts the host-reserved generic routes (``/health``, ``/ui``,
``/compute``) so the worker can answer them over the socket; for the in-process host
app these are harmless (the host serves ``/ui``/``/compute`` from its own reserved
param routes and never forwards them here).

Litestar is a base dependency of ``tlc-compute`` (the SDK contract), but it is
imported **here**, not in the import-light :mod:`tlc_plugin_sdk` package
surface — so ``import tlc_plugin_sdk`` stays cheap.
