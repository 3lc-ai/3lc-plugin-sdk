"""Shared helpers for discovering and reading image data from 3LC tables.

Centralizes the image-column discovery and image-reading pattern used across
plugins. Raw paths are read from ``table.table_rows`` (the row view — paths as
stored, no sample-view decoding) and resolved with ``tlc.Url.to_absolute``
against the table URL, mirroring what ``Table.__getitem__`` does internally.
This makes relative, aliased (``<TOKEN>/...``), and cloud (S3/GCS/Azure) paths
all work — rather than being passed straight to ``PIL.Image.open``, which only
handles local filesystem paths.

Porting to tlc core
-------------------
This functionality belongs in the tlc SDK; this module is shaped so the port
is mechanical. Plugins import only from here, so the port touches exactly this
file. Intended core mapping:

- ``get_image_column(table, ...)`` → ``Table.resolve_image_column(name)``
  plus a ``Table.image_columns`` property (schema walk over
  ``STRING_ROLE_IMAGE_URL``).
- ``resolve_image_url(path, table_url)`` → already in core:
  ``Url(path).to_absolute(owner)`` (= ``Table.absolute_url_from_relative``).
- ``load_image(path, table_url)`` → ``ImageHelper.open_image(url)``
  (local file → PIL directly, else ``BytesIO(url.read_bytes())``; faithful
  mode by default — the RGB conversion is this app's policy and stays here).
- ``read_image_from_table(table, idx, col)`` → ``Table.read_image(idx, column)``.
- ``get_image_paths(table, col)`` → ``Table.get_image_urls(column)``.
- ``list_image_urls(folder)`` → needs a **public recursive listing API** in
  core first: ``UrlAdapterRegistry.list_dir`` is not exported from
  ``tlc.url``, and ``Url._list_dir`` is private, single-level, and drops the
  ``is_dir`` flag needed to recurse. Suggested core addition:
  ``Url.list_dir()`` / ``Url.walk()`` returning ``UrlAdapterDirEntry``.

Once those land, each function body here becomes a one-line delegation and
plugin code is untouched.

    One deliberate deviation from core: aliases are expanded **strictly**.
    Core's lenient ``to_absolute`` keeps an unregistered alias in the path and

    "alias not registered" into a confusing FileNotFoundError — or silently-NaN
