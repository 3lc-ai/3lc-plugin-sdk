"""Robustly inject shared client scripts into a plugin UI fragment.

Plugins prepend shared client JS — ``window.PluginJobs`` (job tracking), the alias
pickers, the config form — into their ``ui.html`` fragment so it runs before the
fragment's own handlers. The historical ``html.replace("<script>", …, 1)`` idiom
is a footgun: it matches the first ``<script>`` *substring* anywhere in the file,
including one mentioned in an HTML comment or a string, and silently injects the
client into that wrong spot (or nowhere useful) with **no error** — the symptom is
an ``undefined`` global at click time, far from the cause.

:func:`inject_scripts` targets the first real, inline ``<script>`` *tag* (ignoring
comments and ``src``-ed scripts) and raises if there is none, so a missing or
renamed tag fails loudly instead of dropping the client.
