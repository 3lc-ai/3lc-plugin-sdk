"""Import-light plugin SDK — the contract surface a plugin programs against.

This is the public import path for the plugin contract. Importing it must **not**
pull in the heavy server stack (litestar, python-socketio, uvicorn, the queues,
discovery): a ``venv``-mode plugin installs only this surface, not the full
service. The ``tests/test_import_light.py`` test enforces the boundary.

A plugin subclasses :class:`ComputePlugin` and implements at least
``compute``/``get_ui_fragment``; the optional job/lifecycle hooks ship as no-op
defaults. There is no ``register()`` to call — metadata lives in the plugin
manifest, and the host discovers the plugin via its manifest ``entrypoint``.

The contract is **defined here**, in :mod:`tlc_plugin_sdk.contract`, so it lives
next to :class:`JobContext` and the venv worker on the import-light side of the SDK
boundary — nothing in this package pulls in the server stack. This is the standalone
public ``3lc-compute-plugin-sdk`` distribution: the light base a venv plugin installs (the
host ``3lc-compute`` depends on it, never the reverse). See ``CLAUDE.md``.

# ``SDK_CONTRACT_VERSION`` above is the package version: the *dependency pin* a plugin
# resolves against (``3lc-compute-plugin-sdk>=X,<Y``). The two constants below are finer-grained
# *capability* markers a plugin (or the host) can feature-detect against at runtime:
#
#   * ``PY_CONTRACT`` — the Python-side contract: ``ComputePlugin`` / ``JobContext`` and
#     the ``tlc_plugin_sdk.shared.*`` helpers (what a plugin's Python programs against).
#   * ``JS_CONTRACT`` — the browser-side contract: the ``PLUGIN_API`` / ``PluginJobs`` /
#     ``TlcData`` surface a plugin's ``ui.html`` programs against (see
#     ``contract/plugin-api.d.ts``; the ``PluginJobs`` client ships from THIS package).
#
# Each MINOR axis increments **independently** as features are added to one side without
# the other. Both are always ``<= `` the package version (a capability can only exist in a
# shipped wheel). Bump the package version when EITHER ``PY_CONTRACT`` or ``JS_CONTRACT``
# moves — the wheel is the thing a plugin actually pins, so it must cover both axes.
