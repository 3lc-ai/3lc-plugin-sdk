"""Import-light plugin SDK — the contract surface a plugin programs against.

This is the public import path for the plugin contract. Importing it must **not**
pull in the heavy server stack (litestar, python-socketio, uvicorn, the queues,
discovery): a ``venv``-mode plugin installs only this surface, not the full
service. See ``docs/plugin-isolation.md`` → "The SDK boundary: import-light
module". The :mod:`test_plugin_sdk_import_light` test enforces the boundary.

A plugin subclasses :class:`ComputePlugin` and implements at least
``compute``/``get_ui_fragment``; the optional job/lifecycle hooks ship as no-op
defaults. There is no ``register()`` to call — metadata lives in the plugin
manifest, and the host discovers the plugin via its manifest ``entrypoint``.

The contract is **defined here**, in :mod:`tlc_plugin_sdk.contract`, so it lives
next to :class:`JobContext` and the venv worker on the import-light side of the SDK
boundary — nothing in this package pulls in the server stack. This is the standalone
public ``3lc-plugin-sdk`` distribution: the light base a venv plugin installs (the
host ``3lc-compute`` depends on it, never the reverse). See ``CLAUDE.md``.
