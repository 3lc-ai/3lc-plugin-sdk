"""The plugin SDK contract surface must stay cheap to import.

Importing ``tlc_plugin_sdk`` (which every venv plugin's module does) must not *eagerly*
pull in the web/server stack: litestar and uvicorn are deps but are imported lazily —
only when a worker actually serves — by ``tlc_plugin_sdk.asgi_app`` / ``.worker``, never
by the contract module. The host-only SocketIO server must not be importable here at all.
Checked in a fresh subprocess so an already-imported stack can't mask a regression."""
